- Use manual header manipulation (X-Forwarded-For) to test session fixation.

15.2 Injection Flaws (NoSQL, Command, Script Injection)
- Test all user input with payloads from Arjun and XSStrike.
- Check MongoDB query injection vectors using NoSQL injection payloads.
- Tools: XSStrike for script injection, manual payload crafting for NoSQL.

15.3 API Endpoint Discovery and Abuse
- Use gospider and waybackurls to discover hidden APIs.
- Use JSluice to extract JS endpoints and automate testing.
- Fuzz with ffuf and Arjun on API parameters.

15.4 Token Handling Weaknesses
- Check JWT expiry, signing algorithms, and replay.
- Decode with jwt-cli, attempt token tampering.

15.5 Access Control and Privilege Escalation Vectors
- Map role-based endpoints.
- Test for IDOR using parameter fuzzing with BugBountyToolkit patterns.

15.6 Misconfigurations in CORS and HTTP Headers
- Use manual curl commands and httpx to test CORS policies.
- Tools: Karma_v2 automated scans for common misconfigurations.

15.7 Rate Limit Bypass and Brute-Force Attack Surfaces

- Test password brute force manually or with custom scripts.

15.8 Vulnerable Dependencies and Third-Party Integrations
- Manual review of package.json (if accessible).
- Cross-reference known CVEs with Vuls (https://github.com/future-architect/vuls).

15.9 Information Leakage Through Errors or Debug Information
- Fuzz for verbose error messages using ffuf.
- Manual browsing for stack traces.

15.10 Attack Surface Expansion Through Cloud and External Services
